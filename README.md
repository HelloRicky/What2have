A app to solve daily common problem: What to have for meals

Whoever is suffering typical question twice a day: What to eat for lunch/dinner? We are here to save your life:
Scenario 1: group of friends go out together for lunch, no one could suggest the restaurant name fit everyone:
- activate app to suggest ONE nearby restaurant (base on geo location)
- filter function for selective restaurant (e.g. function, farewell lunch)

Scenario 2: what to have for dinner just you and your partner:
- based on personal mealing history, suggest something you prefer (machine learning)
